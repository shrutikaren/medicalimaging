The packages used in the project is: celluloid, dicom3nifti, jupyter, imgaug, tensorboard, torch, torchio, torchmetrics, torchvision, opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, pydicom. 

The curriculum for the following repository is as follows: 
- Deep Learning Overview: Numpy, Machine Learning concepts, Pytorch Basics, Convolutional Neural Networks 
- Deep Learning Projects: Cardiac Detection, Atrium Segmentation, Lung Tumor Segmentation, 3D Liver Segmentation 

In this repository, I have opened several files which I will explain here. 
- Numpy.ipynb: Basic methods walkthrough in Numpy(beginner level)
- Numpy2.ipynb: Basic methods walkthrough in Numpy Part II (beginner level)
- Numpy3.ipynb: Basic methods walkthrough in Numpy Part III (intermediate level)
- Numpy4.ipynb: Basic methods walkthrough in Numpy Part IV (intermediate level)
